# 🛒 E-Commerce Customer Churn Analysis

A machine learning project focused on predicting and analyzing customer churn for an e-commerce platform. This notebook explores key factors that influence customer retention using data preprocessing, visualization, and classification model.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for e-commerce platforms, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to:

* Understand patterns behind customer churn
* Identify important churn predictors
* Develop a predictive model to classify churned customers

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains records of customer activity and engagement. Each row represents a customer with features such as:

* Customer ID
* Tenure
* Transactional data
* Browsing behavior
* Support interactions
* Churn status (target variable)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas**, **NumPy** – data manipulation
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – model building and evaluation
* **Jupyter Notebook** – analysis and documentation

---

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**
   Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and ensure data integrity.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   Visualizations to understand churn patterns, correlations, and customer behavior.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   Create and select relevant features to improve model performance.

4. **Model Building**
   Implement classification models -XGBoost

5. **Evaluation**
   Evaluate model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 📌 Key Results

* Identified top factors influencing churn, such as tenure, CashbackAmount,etc
* Achieved high accuracy by hypperparameter tuning using sklearn.metrics
* Provided insights that could help e-commerce companies reduce churn
